# ⚽ Sport Streaming Landing Page Clone

This is a **landing page clone** of a beautifully designed sport streaming platform. The UI is built with **Tailwind CSS v4**, and interactive animations are powered by **Framer Motion**. The goal was to replicate the design and user experience of the original website as closely as possible for practice and portfolio purposes.

> 🎯 This project focuses on layout, styling, and animation—not on backend or streaming functionality.
